            I was born in Shangrao, China. I was adopted a little after I turned one, and moved with my new family to Saint Paul, Minnesota.
            I have an older sister who was also adopted from China (a different area), and a little brother who was a surprise!

            I am currently a senior at the University of Denver, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
            I am also minoring in math and marketing.<br><br>
            During the Fall Semester in 2018, I studied abroad in Taiwan at Yuan Ze University.
            That opportunity introduced me to another culture, and developed my indepence and ability to adapt to new environments.<br><br>
            In my time at DU, I have held multiple leadership positions in various student groups.<br>
            I sit on the University of Denver Programming Board's executive board as the Marketing Committee Chair for two years.
            Creating brand and individual event marketing campaigns, and helping develop the skills of committee members.<br>
            I am also a member of Tri Delta, and have held multiple leadership positions through the sorority.
            My sophomore year I was the External Philanthropy Chair, and helped coordinate community service opportunities for members.
            I was the Vice President of Finance the quarter following my semester abroad.
            Then I transitioned into my current position, Vice President of Public Relations.

            I have had multiple internship opportunities, that have helped me grow professionally.<br><br>
            I spent the summers of 2018 and 2019 interning with 3M's Corporate Systems Research Lab (CRSL).
            The first summer I worked on an agile scrum team using Amazon Web Services (AWS), and helped facilitate a lab wide Alexa Skills Challenge.<br><br>
            The scrum team I worked with the second summer was using Microsoft Azure for the backend of a web UI thats objective was to democratize modeling at 3M.
            I was also able to participate in a hackathon. My hackathon team worked on an ionic mobile application to help connect refugees to resources they might need in a new city.
