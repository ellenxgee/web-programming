Project01: The Static Web
Ellen Gee

For this project, I made the base for a personal website.
index.html serves as the home page,
about.html has more information about me,
and contact.html contains a form to contact me through.

Each of these pages have an <h1> element,
<nav> to get between the three pages,
and a <footer> that has photo links to my Instagram and LinkedIn profiles.

Images can be found at the top of each page, as well as on the Home page.
The <table> element is in about.html, and lists different classes I have taken.
There is a colspan over "Minors",
and rowspans over course sequences that signify the number of quarters the sequence was.
I have an <ol> of some of my favorite things,
and unordered lists nested in <dl> in about.html describing my leadership experience.
My <form> is in contact.html, it has two fieldsets (General Information and Additional Information).
The form has a few different types of inputs.
It has text and email inputs, as well as a drop down menu that has optgroups, and a textarea.
There are submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the form.

I believe I exceeded the basic requirements of this project, which can be seen through the description of work above.
I also did some CSS styling throughout the three pages.
